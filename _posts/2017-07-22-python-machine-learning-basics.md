title: Machine Learning Resources for Python [Basic]
---

There are lots of github repositories and blogs that have more exhaustive resources than what I've put down here that covers a whole lot. But these would be good to start off, I'll put together an intermediate list in the next post.

### Understanding Anaconda distribution & using it for Machine Learning(ML)

As someone starting off with ML & using Python to do it, you will have to understand that ML or Data Science is more of sharing, collaboration and involves you having to share all your findings/research/outcomes to the stake-holders or engineering folks that would use it. Anaconda distribution is one such means through which you will keep yourself sane as well as keep others sane.

Right from the start, try using Jupyter notebooks rather than an IDE, this will help you to explore more and document your findings/issues/quirks without leaving the notebook. 

- [Installation](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)
    * NOTE: If you have Windows, just download the conda installer for Windows and install .exe file
    * NOTE: If you have Ubuntu/Mac, use `wget <url link>`

### Python for Data Science

You have to learn about a few libraries that are core pillars of Python:

### A few blogs that regularly you will need to refer regularly

- [Analytics Vidhya - They have decent ML/Data Science related articles for theory and handson]()
- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/blog)
- [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/)
- [yHat blog](http://blog.yhat.com/)
- [Chris Albon - Whenever you get stuck,don't know a syntax](https://chrisalbon.com/)

### Generic Reading

- [Role of Data Science team](http://bigdata-doctor.com/role-data-scientist-data-driven-organization/)
- [What are the steps for Data Analysis](https://www.quora.com/Data-Analysis/What-are-the-steps-of-a-data-analysis-process)

### Regular Reading

- You'll need to make sure you read at least one article related to ML/DL/Data Science EVERYDAY. You understand it or not is a different thing, but it would help you to think about why/what/how. If you understand, it would add more to your understanding, if not then you can read more about it. Few reading feeds you can follow are:
    - [Medium publication - Becoming Human (ML/DL/Data Science)](https://becominghuman.ai/)
    - [Medium publication - Towards Data Science ((ML/DL/Data Science -- recommended)](https://medium.com/towards-data-science)
    - [Medium publication - freeCodeCamp (Software Engg, ML, DL -- recommended)](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/)
    - [Medium publication - HackerNoon (Software Engg, ML, DL -- recommended)](https://hackernoon.com/)
    
### Books that would help

- [Introduction to ML using Python by Sarah Guido & Andreas Mueller](http://www.amazon.in/Introduction-Machine-Learning-Andreas-Mueller/dp/1449369413/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1500704132&sr=8-1&keywords=introduction+to+scikit+learn)

Do let me know if this a good list for a beginner or would have to add/remove anything. Enjoy & learn!
