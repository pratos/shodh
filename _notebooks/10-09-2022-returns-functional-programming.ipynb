    "\n",
    "Python doesn't let you write functional code out of the box. There's a good chance, the \"functional\" code you might write isn't functional. I'm definitely not here to discuss the intricacies of functional programming, just the experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are aware of `map`, `filter`, `functools`, `itertools` and lots of other niceties, which proxies for leveraging nicer parts of functional programming APIs. These let you do the functional things. But I wanted to satisfy my itch for abstractions that would help me leverage functional paradigms more accessible (maybe?). This led me to [returns](https://github.com/dry-python/returns)."

    "When an opportunity arose, I jumped at using `returns`. As a team, we had planned to use `returns`, but our attempts were half hearted at best. Using `returns` was a rocky, but enlightening experience.\n",

    "> Many examples in functional programming assume that you are always on the ‚Äúhappy path‚Äù. But to create a robust real world application you must deal with validation, logging, network and service errors, and other annoyances.

    "`._inner_value` could be anything that you want to share: _dict, str, Object, Query row, json_. This opens up a lot of avenues to play around with `pydantic` Models or `dataclasses` that help standardize API responses, sql orm models!\n",

    "`returns` doesn't have a great documentation. It would be hard to blame the maintainers coz one needs to atleast understand basics of functional programming (`currying`, `partial`, `Optional`, `Maybe` containers). A comprehensive documentation/examples about more real life usage could help more non-chad devs like us.\n",

    "Combined with `OOPS`, `returns` would definitely be an alternative to write cleaner, readable code. One could also ditch `returns` entirely and work with `functools`, `dataclasses` and `types` in python to write similar helpers, decorators in vanilla python. Maybe that could be another blog post.\n",
