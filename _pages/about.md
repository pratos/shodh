I'm Prathamesh Sarang, a software engineer by profession. I wanted to become an advertising guy in the near past, but fate chose me to grind in front of the computer.

Long suffering Mumbaikar and Arsenal fan. Current interests outside of work are Trivia, Quizzing, Medieval History, Fantasy Premier League and Football.

My life after software engineer, would love to work as a barber or historian at a university.
